# Point-in-time recovery

!!! admonition "Version added: [1.3.0](../release-notes/1.3.0.md)"

Point-in-time recovery is restoring a database up to a specific timestamp. This includes restoring the data from a backup snapshot and replaying all events that occurred to this data up to a specified time from [oplog slices](#oplog-slicing). 

| Advantages                     | Disadvantages                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Helps you prevent data loss during a disaster such as crashed database, accidental data deletion or drop of tables, unwanted update of multiple fields instead of a single one | Restore takes longer since it requires to restore the backup and then replay oplog events on top of it|

## Oplog slicing

To start saving [oplog slices](../reference/glossary.md#oplog), the following preconditions must be met:

* A full backup snapshot is required. Make sure that a [backup exists](../usage/list-backup.md). See the [Start a backup](../usage/start-backup.md) guide to make a backup snapshot.
* Point-in-time recovery routine is enabled. To do that, set the `pitr.enabled` configuration option to `true`.

    === "Command line"

         ```sh
         pbm config --set pitr.enabled=true
         ```

    === "Configuration file"

         ```yaml
         pitr:
           enabled: true
         ```

The `pbm-agent` periodically saves consecutive slices of the [oplog](../reference/glossary.md#oplog). A method similar to the way replica set nodes elect a new primary is used to select the `pbm-agent` that saves the oplog slices. (Find more information in [pbm-agent](../details/pbm-agent.md).)

If you just enabled point-in-time recovery, it requires 10 minutes for the first chunk to appear in the [`pbm list`](../reference.md#pbm-list) output.

!!! important

    **For in MongoDB 5.0 and higher versions**

    If you [reshard](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/sharding-reshard-a-collection/) a collection, make a fresh backup and re-enable point-in-time recovery oplog slicing to prevent data inconsistency and restore failure.

### Oplog duration

!!! admonition "Version added: [1.6.0](../release-notes/1.6.0.md)"

By default, a slice covers a 10 minute span of oplog events. It can be shorter if point-in-time recovery is disabled or interrupted by the start of a backup snapshot operation.

You can change the duration of an oplog span via the configuration file. Specify the new value (in minutes) for the `pitr.oplogSpanMin` option.

=== "Command line"

     ```sh
     pbm config --set pitr.oplogSpanMin=5
     ```

=== "Configuration file"

     ```yaml
     pitr:
       oplogSpanMin: 5
     ```

If you set the new duration when the `pbm-agent` is making an oplog slice, the sliceâ€™s span is updated right away.

If the new duration is shorter, this triggers the `pbm-agent` to make a new slice with the updated span immediately. If the new duration is larger,  the `pbm-agent` makes the next slice with the updated span in its scheduled time.

### Compressed oplog slices 

!!! admonition "Version added: [1.7.0](../release-notes/1.7.0.md)"

The oplog slices are saved with the `s2` compression method by default. You can specify a different compression method via the configuration file. Specify the new value for the `pitr.compression` option.

=== "Command line"

     ```sh
     pbm config --set pitr.compression=gzip
     ```

=== "Configuration file"

     ```yaml
     pitr:
       compression: gzip
     ```

Supported compression methods are: `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `s2`, `pgzip`, `zstd`.

Additionally, you can override the compression level used by the compression method by setting the [`pitr.compressionLevel`](../reference/ptr-options.ms#pitrcompressionlevel) option. The default values differ for each compression level. 

Note that the higher value you specify, the more time and computing resources it will take to compress the data.

!!! note 

    You can use different compression methods for backup snapshots and point-in-time recovery slices. However, backup snapshot-related oplog is compressed with the same compression method as the backup itself.

## View oplog slices

The oplog slices are stored in the `pbmPitr` subdirectory in the [remote storage defined in the config](../details/storage-configuration.md#storage-config). A slice name reflects the start and end time this slice covers.

The [`pbm list`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-list) output includes the following information:

* Backup snapshots. As of version 1.4.0, it also shows the completion time (renamed to the `restore_to_time` in version 2.0.0)
* Valid time ranges for recovery
* Point-in-time recovery status

   ```sh
   pbm list

     2021-08-04T13:00:58Z [restore_to_time: 2021-08-04T13:01:23Z]
     2021-08-05T13:00:47Z [restore_to_time: 2021-08-05T13:01:11Z]
     2021-08-06T08:02:44Z [restore_to_time: 2021-08-06T08:03:09Z]
     2021-08-06T08:03:43Z [restore_to_time: 2021-08-06T08:04:08Z]

## Delete backups

!!! admonition "Version added: 1.6.0"

Backup snapshots and oplog slices are deleted using separate commands: [`pbm delete-backup`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-delete-backup) and [`pbm delete-pitr`](../reference/pbm-commands.md#pbm-delete-pitr) respectively.

### Delete backup snapshots

For Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.6.0 and later versions, see [delete backups](delete-backup.md#considerations) for backup deletion flow.

!!! admonition ""

    For Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.5.0 and earlier versions, when you delete a backup, all oplog slices that relate to this backup are deleted too. For example, you delete a backup snapshot `2020-07-24T18:13:09` while there is another snapshot `2020-08-05T04:27:55` created after it.  The **pbm-agent** deletes only oplog slices that relate to `2020-07-24T18:13:09`.

    The same applies if you delete backups older than the specified time.

    Note that when point-in-time recovery is enabled, the most recent backup snapshot and oplog slices that relate to it are not deleted.

### Delete oplog slices



Running `pbm delete-pitr` allows you to delete old and/or unnecessary slices and save storage space. To see the oplog slices, use the `pbm list` command.

If you have deleted the snapshot and want to delete the oplog slices, use the `pbm list --unbacked` command to view them.

You can either delete all chunks by passing the  `--all` flag. Or you can delete all slices that are made earlier than the specified time by passing the `--older-than` flag. In this case, specify the timestamp as an argument for `pbm delete-pitr` in the following format:

* `%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S` (for example, 2021-07-20T10:01:18) or
* `%Y-%M-%D` (2021-07-20).

```sh
pbm delete-pitr --older-than 2021-07-20T10:01:18
```

To enable [point in time recovery](point-in-time-recovery.md#restore-to-the-point-in-time) from the most recent backup snapshot, Percona Backup for MongoDB does not delete slices that were made after that snapshot. For example, if the most recent snapshot is `2021-07-20T07:05:23Z [restore_to_time: 2021-07-21T07:05:44]` and you specify the timestamp `2021-07-20T07:05:44`, Percona Backup for MongoDB deletes only slices that were made before `2021-07-20T07:05:23Z`.
