# Supported MongoDB deployments

Percona Backup for MongoDB works with sharded clusters and replica sets. It doesnâ€™t work on standalone MongoDB instances. This is because Percona Backup for MongoDB requires [oplog](reference/glossary.md#oplog) to guarantee backup consistency. Oplog is available on nodes with replication enabled.

For testing purposes, you can deploy Percona Backup for MongoDB on a single-node replica set. To convert a standalone server into a replica set, specify the `replication.replSetName` option in the configuration file.
