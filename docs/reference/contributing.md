# Submitting bug reports or feature requests

If you find a bug in Percona Backup for MongoDB, you can submit a report to the [JIRA issue tracker](https://jira.percona.com/projects/PBM)
for Percona Backup for MongoDB.

Start by searching the open tickets for a similar report. If you find that
someone else has already reported your problem, then you can upvote that report
to increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report following these steps:


1. Sign in to [JIRA issue tracker](https://jira.percona.com/projects/PBM). You will need to create an account if you
do not have one.


2. In the *Summary*, *Description*, *Steps To Reproduce*, *Affects Version* fields
describe the problem you have detected. For PBM the important diagnostic
information is: log files from the pbm-agents; a dump of the
PBM control collections.

As a general rule of thumb, try to create bug reports that are:


* *Reproducible*: describe the steps to reproduce the problem.


* *Specific*: include the version of Percona Backup for MongoDB, your environment, and so on.


* *Unique*: check if there already exists a JIRA ticket to describe
the problem.


* *Scoped to a Single Bug*: only report one bug in one JIRA ticket.
