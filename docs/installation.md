After the installation completes, you have the following tools:

| Tool            | Purpose                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------|
| `pbm`           | Command-line interface for controlling the backup system |
| `pbm-agent`     | An agent for running backup/restore actions on a database host |
| `pbm-speed-test`| An interface for field-testing compression and backup upload speed|
| `pbm-agent-entrypoint` | An entry point application that allows starting `pbm-agent` and also restarts it in case of any faults| 

## What nodes to install on

### `pbm-agent`

Install `pbm-agent` on all servers that have `mongod` nodes in the
MongoDB cluster (or non-sharded replica set). You don't need to start it on the `arbiter` node, since it doesnâ€™t have the data set.

### `pbm` CLI

You can install `pbm` CLI on any or all servers or desktop computers you wish to use it from. Those computers must not be network-blocked from accessing the MongoDB cluster.
