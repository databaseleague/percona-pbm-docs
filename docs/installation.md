# Install Percona Backup for MongoDB

## Supported platforms

Percona Backup for MongoDB is available for the most 64-bit Linux distributions. Find the list of supported platforms on the [Percona Software and Platform Lifecycle](https://www.percona.com/services/policies/percona-software-platform-lifecycle#mongodb) page.

## What nodes to install on

### `pbm-agent`

Install [`pbm-agent`](details/pbm-agent.md) on all servers that have `mongod` nodes in the
MongoDB cluster (or non-sharded replica set). You don't need to start it on the `arbiter` node, since it doesnâ€™t have the data set.

### `pbm` CLI

You can install [`pbm` CLI](details/cli.md) on any or all servers or desktop computers you wish to use it from. Those computers must not be network-blocked from accessing the MongoDB cluster.
